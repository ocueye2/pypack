PyPack
an easy way to share python scripts with requirement
PyPack is a simple shell script I wrote because I wanted a one command way to run any python script. 
It works by installing the desired python version (if needed), making a venv, and installing all of the dependencys. 

just edit the version and program variables in the run.sh and the requirements.txt in PyPack folder.
